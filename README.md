[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/CS130-W20/team-B5.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/CS130-W20/team-B5)

Brain.ai is a web application that performs deep-learning-based brain extraction for medical imaging researchers.It allows researchers with limited or no programming background to make use of deep learning on their brain extraction task by providing the necessary software frameworks and computation power. 

## Directory Structure
- The `backend` directory contains code for the backend.
- The `docs` directory contains API specification as well as API documents.
- The `worker` directory contains the work that runs machine learning training/prediction
- The `frontend` directory contains code for web frontend.
## Installation/Run instructions
To run the application, first download the repo:
`git clone git@github.com:CS130-W20/team-B5.git`
`cd team-B5`

For backend servers, go into that folder and then run npm command:
`cd backend`  
`npm start`

For frontend, go into the folder and then run npm command:
`cd frontend`
`npm start`

For workers, go into the folder and run the `main` script.
